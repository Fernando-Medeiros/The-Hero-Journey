## About
<hr>

This is my first personal project \o/

I started this game to practice programming, I chose to make this game because it would be fun and also a challenge.

It's in the first version, I'll add and refine it over time, but for now you can download and play. (Soon I will share the executable on google drive.)

The Hero's Journey is a turn-based rpg, and its plot takes place on a continent in chaos between factions, kingdoms, races and even worlds.


### The current scope:

<li>
Choose from three ethnicities of Elves
</li>
<li>
Choose from three classes according to your chosen ethnicity
</li>
<li>
Create and Delete characters (up to 9 characters saved)
</li>
<li>
Level progression system
</li>
<li>
55 areas to venture into and battle with region-specific opponents.
</li>
<li>
Battle system (Attack, Defend and Evade)
</li>
<li>
Battle Status System (Dodge, Block, Critical)
</li>
<li>
Intuitive battle log
</li>
