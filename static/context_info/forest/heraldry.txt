    The most reclusive of all surface elves are those who still guard the forests.
They are similar in appearance to gray elves or high elves,
but their robes define their tribal and savage origins.
They have great skills in the forests, where they prefer to stay most of the time.
Unlike gray elves (who build their cities highly ranked)
or high elves (who prefer communities of other races),
wood elves prefer to live in nomadic and wild groups, defending their territory.
