    The Gray Elves are among the most noble and reclusive among elven society,
they are an offshoot of the original high elves' lineage.
They walked away from the world after leaving their mark, which was to ensure that the world
was in the way of the gods. The Gray Elves see themselves as protectors of the good in the world,
but they will only descend from their mountains and meadows to protect some "lesser" race,
if it is facing great evil.
Gray Elves are arrogant and condescending, full of self-importance.
They never speak their minds, as long as it maintains the nobility of the elves.
They avoid contact with other races, including other elves. 
They are not exactly intolerant of other races,
but they do believe in the purity of the elven lineage. 
Only powerful mages are allowed into their mountain citadels,
and even then they are met with great suspicion.
Taller and thinner than other elves, Gray Elves have dark hair and eyes, some of which are rare.
may have very light golden hair, and purple eyes. These elves are often confused
with fairies and were probably the first to have contact with humans.
