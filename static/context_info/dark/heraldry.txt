   Physically, dark elves are similar to surface elves. However,
their skin is as black as ebony, and their hair is white or silver.
Unlike other elves, who maintain a relationship of respect,
and harmony with the forests and woods where they live,
dark elves maintain a relationship of domination with everything around them.
Even the caves and tunnels that form their cities are subjugated,
shaped and distorted to suit their designs.
Dark elves are skilled artisans, and their stone and metalworking is famous even on the surface.
Traditionally, dark elves are selfish and evil,
and their entire culture and society is built around the concept of power at all costs.
Dark elf citadels are treacherous places,
where the rich and powerful play a dangerous game of power,
in which those of lower caste are mere pawns, completely expendable.
Dark elves have a great appreciation for magic of any kind,
and spell casters tend to occupy a prominent place in their communities.
